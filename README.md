# This is my mini project from zTm course. It's a script that takes a txt based file, translates all lines in it and makes new file with translated lines.
I worked only few hours on this project so it's not completely error proof and you can't use all languages because of encoding issues. However there is a lot of languages that work properly and I listed few in it. I did this project as a practice of working with File I/O and modules.
Module used in this project : https://pythonrepo.com/repo/nidhaloff-deep-translator-python-miscellaneous
